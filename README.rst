Project timeline planner plugin for sphinx
==========================================

This plugin creates a project timeline out of a Sphinx_ document consisting of
several sections of project tasks.  It computes the requested time for this
project and defined milestones or deadlines.  This allows the user to stay on
top of the development tasks, and it is requires far less maintenance than
other project management tools.
